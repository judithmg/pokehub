# Pokemon Hub

This is my final project built during my stay at Skylab Coders Academy.

This is a **React** app that uses **Redux** for stage management, and on the server side, build with **NodeJs**, connects to a **Mongo Database**.

The project is tested with **Jest**.

### What can a I do in Pokemon Hub?

This app allows the unlogged users to check data for every Pokemon by using the **Pokedex**. If users login, they can use the team creator option to create teams that can later be used for **performing battles** using the in-game option.
